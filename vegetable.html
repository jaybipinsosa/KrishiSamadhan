        <p class="lead"> The onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa "onion"), also known as the bulb onion or common
          onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium.
          The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2010. The
          onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of
          the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened,
          compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central
          bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage
          dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle. The crop is harvested
          and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and
          diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi which can cause rotting.
          Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs. Onions are cultivated
          and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually served cooked, as a vegetable or part of
          a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when
          chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes.<br></p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Radish<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
        <p class="lead"> The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an edible root vegetable of the family
          Brassicaceae that was domesticated in Asia prior to Roman times.
          Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with
          a pungent flavor. There are numerous varieties,
          varying in size, flavor, color, and length of time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the
          various chemical compounds produced by the plants,
          including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and
          suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly
          and grow rapidly, common smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon
          varieties take several months. Being easy to grow and quick to
          harvest, radishes are often planted by novice gardeners. Another use of radish is as a cover or catch crop in
          winter, or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for
          their seeds; others, such as daikon, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.<br></p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Eggplant<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
        <p class="lead"> Eggplant (US, Australia, New Zealand, anglophone Canada), aubergine (UK,Ireland, Quebec, and
          most of mainland Western Europe) or brinjal (South Asia, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa)
          is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Solanum melongena is grown worldwide for its edible
          fruit.Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines.
          Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus
          Solanum, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the
          New World while the eggplant is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like
          the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient
          and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through
          cooking expands its use in the culinary arts.It was originally domesticated from the wild
          nightshade species thorn or bitter apple, S. incanum, probably with two independent domestications: one in
          South Asia, and one in East Asia.[9] In 2018, China and India combined accounted for 87% of the world
          production of eggplants.<br></p>
