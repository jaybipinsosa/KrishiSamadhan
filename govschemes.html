            <p>
                In order to make agriculture more productive, sustainable, remunerative and climate resilient, the
                Government of India introduced National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) in the year 2014-15.
                To achieve these goals, the mission promotes location specific sustainable and best farming practices;
                soil conservation and moisture protection measures; soil nutrient management; efficient and sustainable
                water management practices with mainstreaming rainfed methods.

                As a major component of the mission, ‘On Farm Water Management’ (OFWM) is being implemented with the
                objective of increasing water use efficiency by promoting modern technologies such as micro irrigation
                and sustainable water management practices, efficient water consumption, better distribution channels
                along with secondary storage facilities.

            <p>
                The extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods and hailstorms cause crop failures and financial
                loss to the farmers every year. And therefore, to save them from these ill effects, the Government, by
                merging all previous crop insurance schemes, launched Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from
                Kharif 2016 season with the aim to support production in agriculture by providing an affordable crop
                insurance system.

                Central government has made Aadhaar mandatory for availing crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season. The
                scheme has been restructured with states given option to determine scale of finance at district level as
                per average yield.

                extend the coverage of irrigation and improving water use efficiency in a focused manner. PMKSY focuses
                end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, field application and extension
                activities. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had approved the irrigation scheme on July 1,,
                2015.

                The Centre has structured the scheme with merging previous irrigation and water management programmes
                such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), Integrated Watershed Management Programme
                (IWMP) and On Farm Water Management (OFWM) scheme. The Centre has approved Rs. 50,000 crore for five
                years for the implementation of the flagship irrigation scheme across India.

                Parampragat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is one of the important government schemes which encourages
                farmers for traditional and organic farming in India. Under the scheme, the Government of India provides
                a financial assistance to the farmers of Rs 50,000 per hectare every three years for organic inputs,
                certification, labelling, packaging, transportation and marketing of organic produce. The scheme focuses
                on reducing the ill effects of overuse of fertilisers and agrochemicals by promoting organic manures,
                bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides. It helps improve the soil fertility by improving organic carbon in
                the soil which results in enhancing moisture holding capacity in the field too.

                taking up special and innovative projects and also for incentivising micro irrigation beyond the

                Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), eNAM aims at reducing transaction costs, bridging
                information asymmetries, and helping expansion of market access for farmers and other stakeholders.
                Since the implementation, e-NAM has registered a user base of 1.66 crore farmers, 1.31 lakh traders,

                In a bid to provide adequate and timely credit to the farmers for their agricultural expenditures, the
                Central government had launched Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme in the year 1998. Under the scheme, the
                Government of India provides farm credit at a very subsidised rate of 4 percent per annum. Since 2019,
                the Centre has extended the benefits of Kisan Credit Card to animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries
                farmers for their working capital requirement and raising the existing limit of collateral free loan
                from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs.1.60 lakh.

                As part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package, the Centre has announced to cover 2.5 crore farmers under
                KCC scheme with a credit boost of Rs 2 lakh crore through a special drive. As a result, till October 19,
                2020, according to the Government of India’s data, the package has disbursed Rs. 1.35 lakh crore to 1.5
                crore farmers under the scheme.

                With an objective of conserving and maintaining soil nutrient and soil fertility, Soil Health Card (SHC)
                scheme issues soil health cards to the farmers every two years to provide a basis to address nutritional
                deficiencies in the fields. Under the scheme, soil testing is conducted to analyse the nutrient needs,
                then crop-wise fertilisers are recommended accordingly. This reduces cultivation cost by application of
                right fertilisers with right quantity.

                In the next five years, the Centre has targeted to cover 400,000 villages under individual farm holding
                soil sampling and testing, organise 2.5 lakh demonstrations, set up of 250 village level soil testing
                labs, strengthening 200 soil testing labs and promotion of micro-nutrients in two lakh hectare area.
